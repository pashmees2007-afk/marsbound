# Evidence-First MARSBOUND Tasks

- [x] Simplify the entry screen into a restrained mission briefing and terrain acquisition interface.
- [x] Center the analysis view on the terrain image, intermediate OpenCV outputs, and computed risk map.
- [x] Present derived hazard, zone, and ranking data as scientific evidence rather than decorative dashboard metrics.
- [x] Elevate the landing recommendation as a compact mission decision with inspectable reasons and report data.
- [x] Retain verified sample data, preserve upload staging, and keep the demo flow explicit about backend limitations.
- [x] Verify the revised desktop and mobile workflow, then save a finished project checkpoint.

## AI4Mars Label Archive Review

- [x] Inventory the archive files, formats, and image-to-label relationships.
- [x] Quantify available terrain classes and annotation geometry relevant to rocks, craters, and safe-zone assessment.
- [x] Compare the label structure with MARSBOUND’s existing classical-vision evidence and risk-grid outputs.
- [x] Recommend immediate evidence-viewer integrations and a longer-term training/evaluation path.
- [x] Acquire matching source images and prepare an MSL-only merged-label seed for evaluation and baseline model development.

## AI4Mars MSL Source Acquisition

- [x] Document the prepared subset and recommended backend integration path for MARSBOUND.
- [x] Defer expansion from the 49-pair MSL seed to the full 16,064-pair corpus until dedicated model training begins; the live backend does not require the full corpus.

- [x] Verify the viewer’s desktop and mobile controls, then save a project checkpoint.

## Segmentation Backend and Ground-Truth Comparison

- [x] Define the upload, inference, and prediction-versus-ground-truth result contract with clear model provenance.
- [x] Upgrade MARSBOUND for server-side uploads, API routes, and persistent analysis records.
- [x] Implement segmentation inference with a disclosed baseline method for arbitrary terrain uploads.

- [x] Verify mobile comparison controls and the updated upload workflow on the full-stack build.
- [x] Save the validated full-stack segmentation and comparison update as a project checkpoint.
- [x] Verify the actual mobile upload-to-server-prediction path on the full-stack build.
- [x] Save the verified full-stack segmentation and comparison update as a project checkpoint.
- [x] Save a final project checkpoint containing the verified backend, comparison interface, and responsive upload-flow validations.

## Semantic Segmentation Network

- [x] Confirm available training runtime and define an image-level train/validation/test split from matched MSL pairs.
- [x] Prepare normalized image-mask tensors with ignored unlabeled pixels and class-weighted loss.
- [x] Train a compact semantic segmentation network and save reproducible model artifacts.
- [x] Evaluate the network against the held-out test split and compare it with the prototype baseline.
- [x] Retain the selected evaluated baseline in server-side inference because the candidate did not improve held-out macro F1.
- [x] Verify trained-model evaluation artifacts and preserve the existing validated upload, prediction, comparison, and responsive UI flows.

## Rare-Hazard Segmentation Improvement

 - [x] Measure current big-rock, sand, bedrock, and soil coverage across the matched MSL seed and preserve an image-level held-out test split.
 - [x] Create high-resolution training patches that oversample labelled big-rock and sand regions while retaining regular terrain coverage.
 - [x] Train a class-balanced segmentation network with focal loss and terrain-preserving augmentation.
 - [x] Compare held-out macro F1 and per-class rare-hazard F1 against the original U-Net and server baseline.
 - [x] Promote a model only if it improves the held-out rare-hazard criteria; otherwise retain the current disclosed baseline.
 - [x] Document the experiment and update MARSBOUND only for a validated improvement.

## Expanded AI4Mars MSL Training

- [x] Retrieve an expanded, directly matched MSL image-and-label corpus from the official AI4Mars archive without adding large assets to the web project.
- [x] Audit class presence per image and build image-level stratified train, validation, and held-out test splits that include sand and big-rock evidence.
- [x] Train a segmentation candidate on the expanded corpus with rare-hazard-aware sampling and reproducible evaluation artifacts.
- [x] Compare the expanded-data candidate with the current server baseline using held-out macro F1 and per-class terrain F1.
- [x] Integrate a candidate into MARSBOUND only if it outperforms the active baseline under the fixed held-out evaluation.
- [x] Run tests and validate the upload-to-prediction web flow after any model integration, then document the outcome.

## Recovered Expanded-Corpus Training Run

- [x] Inventory the 118 matched MSL pairs recovered from the interrupted official selective download and retain their per-image provenance.
- [x] Build stratified image-level splits from the recovered corpus with rare terrain classes represented in both validation and test sets where available.
- [x] Train and evaluate an expanded-data candidate, then retain or promote it strictly by held-out macro F1 and per-class F1.

## Larger AI4Mars Corpus Expansion

- [x] Build a robust resumable retrieval workflow that expands beyond the recovered 118 matched MSL pairs without downloading unpaired data into the web project.
- [x] Save source-archive provenance for every newly retrieved rover image and semantic label pair.
- [x] Audit terrain-class coverage and create a new stratified image-level train, validation, and held-out test split with rare hazards represented where available.
- [x] Train and evaluate a larger-corpus candidate against the current v2 model on a common held-out test set.
- [x] Promote the candidate in MARSBOUND only if it improves held-out macro F1 and does not regress rare-hazard F1 materially.
- [x] Re-run unit tests and desktop/mobile upload validation after any model promotion, then document the result.

## 2,500-Pair AI4Mars MSL Training Expansion

- [x] Extend the resumable official MSL retrieval from 718 to 2,500 directly matched rover-image and label pairs without placing training assets in the web project.
- [x] Preserve archive provenance and run an integrity count for the full 2,500-pair corpus.
- [x] Create a fresh class-aware image-level train, validation, and held-out test split with sand and big-rock evidence in evaluation sets.
- [x] Train and evaluate a 2,500-pair terrain candidate against the active v3 model on the same held-out test set.
- [x] Promote the new candidate only if macro F1 improves and the sand/big-rock results remain at least as strong; retain v3 because v4 did not satisfy the rare-hazard threshold.
- [x] Validate the final server model with tests and actual desktop/mobile terrain-upload flows, then document the outcome.

## Hackathon Architecture Diagram

- [x] Map the current MARSBOUND client, server, computer-vision, terrain-classification, storage, database, and decision-support components.
- [x] Render a deterministic end-to-end architecture diagram with data-flow labels and an evidence-first decision boundary.

## 60% Accuracy Dataset Optimization Plan

- [x] Diagnose the active v3 model’s class-level limitations and dataset characteristics relative to the 60% pixel-accuracy target.
- [x] Define rare-hazard-aware sampling, split, label-quality review, and augmentation rules for the 2,500-pair corpus.
- [x] Specify a pretrained segmentation training and strict held-out evaluation path that can improve accuracy without hiding sand or big-rock failures.
- [x] Deliver prioritized milestones and promotion criteria for progressing from the current baseline toward a trustworthy 60% pixel-accuracy target.
